# Disneyland-Sentiment-Analysis
I take the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arushchillar/disneyland-reviews . The dataset consists about reviews on Disnyeland.
The objective of this project is to create a sentiment analysis: classify accurately positive (the reviews with more than 3 stars ) and negative reviews (=< 3 stars ) I began with the Logistic Regression, then I used an RNN through Glove.
